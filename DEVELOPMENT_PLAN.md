# RepoScope Development Plan

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed Features
1. **Authentication System**
   - GitHub OAuth integration
   - User session management
   - Protected routes

2. **Basic Dashboard**
   - Repository selector in header (minimal design)
   - Stats cards showing basic metrics
   - Recent activity feed
   - Quick actions grid

3. **Repository Analysis**
   - Basic analysis page
   - Integration with Gemini API
   - Simple results display

4. **Navigation Structure**
   - Sidebar with cleaned up navigation (removed duplicates)
   - Responsive layout
   - Basic routing

### ðŸš§ Issues to Fix

1. **State Management Problems**
   - Dashboard loses state when navigating away
   - Analysis results are not persisted
   - Need to implement proper state persistence

2. **Analysis Results**
   - Currently showing basic string outputs
   - Need rich, interactive visualizations
   - Missing detailed insights and charts

3. **UI/UX Design**
   - Current design is basic, not glassmorphic/neon as planned
   - Missing animations and visual effects
   - Need to implement the planned color scheme

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Fix State Persistence (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Implement state persistence for dashboard
- [ ] Cache analysis results in Zustand store
- [ ] Add localStorage backup for critical data
- [ ] Implement proper navigation state management

### 2. Enhance Analysis Results (Priority: HIGH)
- [ ] Create rich visualization components:
  - [ ] Commit activity heatmap
  - [ ] Contributor statistics charts
  - [ ] Code quality metrics graphs
  - [ ] Language distribution pie chart
  - [ ] Commit frequency timeline
- [ ] Add interactive elements:
  - [ ] Expandable sections
  - [ ] Drill-down capabilities
  - [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Implement AI insights panel with:
  - [ ] Risk assessment dashboard
  - [ ] Predictive analytics
  - [ ] Actionable recommendations

### 3. Implement Glassmorphic/Neon Design (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Update color scheme:
  ```css
  --bg-primary: #0a0a0a
  --bg-secondary: #111111
  --bg-card: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.8)
  --border: #333333
  --neon-green: #00ff88
  --neon-blue: #00ccff
  --neon-pink: #ff00ff
  ```
- [ ] Add glassmorphic effects:
  - [ ] Backdrop blur on cards
  - [ ] Semi-transparent backgrounds
  - [ ] Gradient borders
- [ ] Implement neon accents:
  - [ ] Glowing buttons
  - [ ] Neon shadows
  - [ ] Animated borders
- [ ] Add Framer Motion animations

### 4. Dashboard Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)
- [ ] Real-time data updates via WebSockets
- [ ] Interactive charts using Recharts
- [ ] Activity timeline with filtering
- [ ] Repository comparison view

### 5. Additional Features (Priority: LOW)
- [ ] Notifications system
- [ ] Settings page implementation
- [ ] Export reports functionality
- [ ] Team collaboration features
